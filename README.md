A node.js library for parsing Counter-Strike Global Offensive (CSGO) demo files.
The library is also Browserify-able, and a standalone bundle that you can `<script src="...">` is available in [browser/bundle.js](browser/bundle.js).

## Supported Demo Features

- Entity updates, server classes, data tables (including instance baselines)
- Both perspectives (GOTV and client-side recorded)
- User messages
- String tables
- Game events
- Console variables

## Installation

### Browser

    <script src="browser/bundle.js"></script>

The `DemoFile` module will be available as `window.demofile`. 

### Node

    npm install --save demofile

Generate documentation to `./docs/`:

    npm run generate-docs

## API

This library provides full access to the data available in CSGO demo files. Unlike some other libraries, `demofile` is feature complete and supports the latest demos. As well as providing high-level APIs to access the state of the game, low-level access is available and is not discouraged.

Take a look at the `examples/dumpfile.js` file for an indication as to how the library can be used to introspect demo files. This example is by no means exhaustive -- see the 'docs' folder for documentation on all public classes and methods.

Note: It is important to note that events are fired at the end of a tick, after all entity props and string tables have been updated.

## Example

Print all player information to console:

```js
var demofile = require('demofile');
var fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('test.dem', function (err, buffer) {
  var demo = new demofile.DemoFile();

  demo.stringTables.on('update', e => {
    if (e.table.name === 'userinfo' && e.userData != null) {
      console.log('Player info updated:');
      console.log(e.entryIndex, e.userData);
    }
  });

  demo.parse(buffer);
});
```
